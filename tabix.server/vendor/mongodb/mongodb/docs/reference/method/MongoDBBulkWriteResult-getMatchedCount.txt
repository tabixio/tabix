Definition
----------

.. phpmethod:: MongoDB\\BulkWriteResult::getMatchedCount()

   Return the total number of documents that were matched by all update and
   replace operations in the bulk write.

   .. code-block:: php

      function getMatchedCount(): integer

   This method should only be called if the write was acknowledged.

   .. note::

      If an update/replace operation results in no change to the document
      (e.g. setting the value of a field to its current value), the matched
      count may be greater than the value returned by
      :phpmethod:`getModifiedCount()
      <MongoDB\\BulkWriteResult::getModifiedCount()>`.

Return Values
-------------

The total number of documents that were matched by all update and replace
operations in the bulk write.
