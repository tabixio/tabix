  Specify ``false`` to disable the automatic creation of an index on the ``_id``
  field.

  .. important::

     For replica sets, do not set ``autoIndexId`` to ``false``.

  .. deprecated:: 3.2. The ``autoIndexId`` option will be removed in MongoDB 3.4.

arg_name: option
name: flags
type: integer
description: |
  Available for the MMAPv1 storage engine only to set the ``usePowerOf2Sizes``
  and ``noPadding`` flags.

  The |php-library| provides constants that you can combine with a :php:`bitwise
  OR operator <language.operators.bitwise>` to set the flag values:

  - ``MongoDB\Operation\CreateCollection::USE_POWER_OF_2_SIZES``: ``1``
  - ``MongoDB\Operation\CreateCollection::NO_PADDING``: ``2``

  Defaults to ``1``.

  .. note::

     MongoDB 3.0 and later ignores the ``usePowerOf2Sizes`` flag. See
     :manual:`collMod </reference/command/collMod>` and
     :manual:`db.createCollection()
     </reference/method/db.createCollection>` for more information.

arg_name: option
name: indexOptionDefaults
type: array|object
description: |
  Allows users to specify a default configuration for indexes when creating a
  collection.

  The ``indexOptionDefaults`` option accepts a ``storageEngine`` document,
  which should take the following form::

     { <storage-engine-name>: <options> }

  Storage engine configurations specified when creating indexes are validated
  and logged to the :term:`oplog` during replication to support replica sets
  with members that use different storage engines.

arg_name: option
name: max
type: integer
description: |
  The maximum number of documents allowed in the capped collection. The ``size``
  option takes precedence over this limit. If a capped collection reaches the
  ``size`` limit before it reaches the maximum number of documents, MongoDB
  removes old documents. If you prefer to use the ``max`` limit, ensure that the
  ``size`` limit, which is required for a capped collection, is sufficient to
  contain the maximum number of documents.

  Specify a maximum size in bytes for a capped collection. Once a capped
  collection reaches its maximum size, MongoDB removes the older documents to
  make space for the new documents. The ``size`` option is required for capped
  collections and ignored for other collections.

arg_name: option
name: storageEngine

  Available for the WiredTiger storage engine only.

  Allows users to specify configuration to the storage engine on a
  per-collection basis when creating a collection. The value of the
  ``storageEngine`` option should take the following form::

     { <storage-engine-name>: <options> }

  Storage engine configurations specified when creating collections are
  validated and logged to the :term:`oplog` during replication to support
  replica sets with members that use different storage engines.

arg_name: option
name: validator
type: array
description: |
  Allows users to specify :manual:`validation rules or expressions
  </core/document-validation>` for the collection. For more information, see
  :manual:`Document Validation </core/document-validation>` in the MongoDB
  manual.

  The ``validator`` option takes an array that specifies the validation rules or
  expressions. You can specify the expressions using the same operators as
  MongoDB's :manual:`query operators </reference/operator/query>` with the
  exception of :query:`$geoNear`, :query:`$near`, :query:`$nearSphere`,
  :query:`$text`, and :query:`$where`.

  .. note::

     - Validation occurs during updates and inserts. Existing documents do not
       undergo validation checks until modification.

     - You cannot specify a validator for collections in the ``admin``,
       ``local``, and ``config`` databases.

     - You cannot specify a validator for ``system.*`` collections.

   Determines whether to ``error`` on invalid documents or just ``warn`` about
   the violations but allow invalid documents to be inserted.

   .. important::

      Validation of documents only applies to those documents as determined by
      the ``validationLevel``.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - ``validationAction``

        - Description

      * - ``"error"``

        - **Default**. Documents must pass validation before the write occurs.
          Otherwise, the write operation fails.

      * - ``"warn"``

        - Documents do not have to pass validation. If the document fails
          validation, the write operation logs the validation failure.

   Determines how strictly MongoDB applies the validation rules to existing

      * - ``validationLevel``

        - Description

      * - ``"off"``

        - No validation for inserts or updates.

      * - ``"strict"``

        - **Default**. Apply validation rules to all inserts and all updates.

      * - ``"moderate"``

        - Apply validation rules to inserts and to updates on existing *valid*
          documents. Do not apply rules to updates on existing *invalid*
          documents.
