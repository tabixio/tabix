arg_name: option
name: collation
type: array|object

   :manual:`Collation </reference/collation>` allows users to specify
   language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for lettercase
   and accent marks. When specifying collation, the ``locale`` field is
   mandatory; all other collation fields are optional. For descriptions of the
   fields, see :manual:`Collation Document
   </reference/collation/#collation-document>`.

   If the collation is unspecified but the collection has a default collation,
   the operation uses the collation specified for the collection. If no
   collation is specified for the collection or for the operation, MongoDB uses
   the simple binary comparison used in prior versions for string comparisons.

   This option is available in MongoDB 3.4+ and will result in an exception at
   execution time if specified for an older server version.

   This is not supported for server versions prior to 3.2 and will result in an
